# BR Discord Bot
A personal Discord bot running in NodeJS, built on DiscordJS, containing scripts that were useful to me at one time or another.

Currently contains scripts for:
- Generating random teams from the users currently in a channel

## Usage:
Create a file `bot_token` that contains the discord token for your bot
(ensure there is no extra line at the end of your file (ex using `nano -L bot_token` will prevent this)).

Then Run:
```
npm install
node server.js
```
